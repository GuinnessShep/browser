### sd-webui-clipboard
Extension for Stable Diffusion Webui that adds a textfield where to store notes, details, prompts, etc between sessions.

Useful if you want to test prompts, adding and removing words, but not knowing where to store them, or if you have found some interesting parameters and you want to remember them without dropping every time the image on the png info tab (if the parameters are even stored in it).

### Installation
Go to the Extensions tab in the webui. In the Install from url paste `https://github.com/GiusTex/sd-webui-clipboard`. Press Install, then close webui terminal and restart it.

### Features
Extension for Stable Diffusion Webui that adds a textfield where to store notes, details, prompts, etc between sessions. More specifically, the script creates a .txt file in the extension folder (you can change the path from the options tab), and you can load that text file from txt2img and img2img, then save it. This way when you reload the page or restart the terminal, you can load the file with the saved notes.

The extensions in the photo are organised that way thanks to [Haoming02 sd-webui-tabs-extension](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-tabs-extension).

The buttons are all english, the "Salva" one is due to my localization, I didn't want to turn it off just for the screen. The search and replace numbers, instead, are lora checkpoint.
